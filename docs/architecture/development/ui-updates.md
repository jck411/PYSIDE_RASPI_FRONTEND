# UI Updates

This section documents recent UI changes:

## UI Updates (May 2025)

### Alarm Screen UI Enhancement (May 2025)
- **In-List Add Button**: Replaced the floating action button with an integrated "Add new alarm" button within the alarm list
- **Consistent Visual Design**: The add button uses the same styling as alarm list items for visual consistency
- **SVG Icon Integration**: Incorporated the `alarm_add.svg` icon for better visual recognition
- **Improved Usability**: The add button now appears at the bottom of the alarm list, making it easy to find and use
- **Alternating Colors**: The add button respects the same alternating color scheme as the alarm items
- **Simplified Interaction**: Clean implementation that retains theme-consistent styling
- **Implementation Details**: The add button is implemented as a footer component in the ListView with:
  - Matching height and visual style to alarm list items for consistency
  - Proper color alternation based on the number of items in the list
  - Clear visual indication of its purpose with icon and text
  - Same interaction pattern as alarm items (tap/click to activate)
  - Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

### Calendar Controls (May 2025)
- **Refresh Button:** A new refresh button was added using the `../icons/refresh.svg` icon (consistent with the Weather screen).
- **Functionality:** This button is intended to trigger a data refresh/sync for calendar events and is currently configured to call `CalendarController.refreshEvents()`.

### Main Navigation (May 2025)
- **Icon Reordering:** The Photos and Clock icons in the main navigation bar were swapped to improve workflow. The order is now: Chat, Weather, Calendar, Photos, Clock, Theme Toggle, Settings.
- **Alignment:** This change provides a more logical grouping by placing the visual content screens (Photos) closer to the Calendar and Weather, with utility screens (Clock, Settings) grouped together.

### Weather Controls UI Update (April 2025)
- **Button Text:** The "7 Day Forecast" navigation button text was shortened to "7 Day".
- **Selected Style:** The visual style for the selected navigation button ("72 Hour" or "7 Day") was updated. The semi-transparent background was removed, and a solid border with the color `#565f89` is now used to indicate selection.
- **Button Width:** Both the "72 Hour" and "7 Day" buttons were set to a fixed `implicitWidth` of 90 pixels for visual consistency.

### Alarm Edit Screen Layout Update (May 2025)
- **Improved Layout**: The alarm edit screen layout was restructured to use a more intuitive arrangement
  - The screen title and name field are positioned side by side at the top of the form
  - Save and Cancel buttons are now positioned at the bottom right of the screen
  - The main content area is organized into three distinct columns:
    - Left column: Time selection with hour/minute tumblers
    - Middle column: Repeat options (Once, Daily, Weekdays, etc.)
    - Right column: Custom day selection (only visible when "Custom" is selected)
  - Column headings are precisely aligned at the same height for visual consistency
  - Content in each column starts at the same vertical position with consistent spacing
- **Enhanced Usability**: The new layout is more consistent with standard form design patterns
  - Improved visual hierarchy with the heading and name field at the top
  - Action buttons (Save/Cancel) are consistently positioned at the bottom right
  - Content organized into logical columns that flow left-to-right
  - Custom days appear as an extension of the repeat options when needed
  - Better use of screen space for a cleaner, more organized interface
  - Consistent spacing and alignment across all form sections

## QML Design Philosophy (May 2025)

The application follows these guidelines for component design and navigation:

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Keep components as simple as possible with minimal properties
   - Avoid complex property bindings that can lead to conflicts
   - Use direct string paths for navigation (e.g., `stackView.replace("ScreenName.qml")`)

2. **Minimize Property Usage**
   - Define only essential properties in components
   - Avoid redefining properties that exist in parent components
   - Be cautious with property initialization, especially for complex types

3. **Direct Navigation**
   - Navigate between screens using simple StackView operations
   - Keep navigation logic straightforward without excessive error handling
   - Avoid creating intermediate components dynamically when possible

4. **Modular Components**
   - Break large components into smaller, focused ones
   - Keep files under 200-300 lines for maintainability
   - Separate visual elements from business logic

These principles help avoid common QML issues like property binding conflicts and component creation errors.
